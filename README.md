# Bank Office Model - Modeling and Simulation

## Overview
This project presents a **Bank Office Model** designed to simulate customer flow and evaluate service efficiency within a banking environment. Using discrete event simulation principles, the model helps analyze operational performance indicators such as ATM usage, queue lengths, service times, and resource utilization.

## Project Objectives
- **Optimize customer service** by simulating and analyzing the flow through ATMs and tellers.
- **Reduce customer wait times** by evaluating queue management strategies.
- **Maximize resource utilization** of human tellers and automated systems.
- **Enhance customer satisfaction** through better service design.

## Agenda
- Problem Statement
- Creating a Simple Model
- Adding Animation to the Model
- Introducing Human Tellers
- Collecting and Analyzing Utilization Statistics

## Problem Statement
The Bank Office model simulates a typical banking service environment. It includes:
- **Customer queues**
- **Automated Teller Machines (ATMs)**
- **Human Tellers**

By analyzing interactions between customers and service points, the model identifies operational bottlenecks and opportunities for improvement.

## Simulation Details

### 1. Creating a Simple Model
- **Flowchart Design**: Models customer arrival, queueing, ATM service delay, and customer exit.
- **Key Components**:
  - **Source**: Customer arrival generation.
  - **Queue**: Waiting line before service.
  - **Delay**: Service time at the ATM.
  - **Sink**: Customer exit after service.

### 2. Creating Model Animation
- **Visual Layout**: Represents the ATM, queues, and customer movement.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Clients shown standing in line, ATM status (busy/idle) displayed.
- **Purpose**: Makes customer flow and system behavior intuitive and engaging.

### 3. Adding Tellers
- **Enhanced Flowchart**:
  - Additional service point introduced (human teller).
  - **Service Block**: Manages resource allocation, service time, and resource release.
- **Benefits**: Simulates mixed-service environments (machines + human staff).

### 4. Collecting Utilization Statistics
- **Metrics Gathered**:
  - ATM and Teller Utilization Rates
  - Average and Maximum Queue Lengths
  - Customer Service Time
- **Objective**: Provide quantitative insights to support data-driven decision-making.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Simulation Software**: (AnyLogic)
- **Animation Tools**: Built-in layout animation features
- **Flowchart Modeling**: Discrete Event Simulation (DES) techniques

## Conclusion
This simulation framework offers a robust foundation for analyzing and optimizing banking operations. By adjusting model parameters, bank offices can explore different strategies to improve service efficiency, balance workloads, and enhance the overall customer experience.
